## Version

Based on kahuzo/picojson 1.1.2-dev (commit: 2120a6c21)

## Why this fork?

This fork intends to deliver picojson in its smallest form i.e. without tests. It also makes some minor changes (such as removing `static` variables) to make it more stable for use in a production environment.

For an up-to-date version, see https://github.com/kazuho/picojson.
